### Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

This is an easy to play game in Python based on the childhood game of Hangman. This Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. I have based the game based on guessing a favourite fruit.

# Building the Code
On this project the code has been built line by line starting with creating a simple list and then printing that list. 
Subsequent updates have entailed building the game, first of all changing the code so that it generates a random word
from the list to adding an input asking for the user to enter one word only. 

This is the first process of building the game.  

The game is coded in Python.

Requirements Python 3.1
